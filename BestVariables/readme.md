[Identification of the best variables for the SM signal search at LHE level](https://github.com/UniMiBAnalyses/HHbblvjj/wiki/Best-Variables-and-Toy-Simulation)

1. Reading and storage of .lhe files 
2. Variables histos and Q factors plot
3. For each variable selection of signal rignion and its "significance level"
4. Shape fit and toy Mc  simulation
